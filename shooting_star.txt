A shooting star in the barren sky,
Zipped through a morbidly cerulean dye.

This stranger from a foreign space,
Enchanted me with poise and grace.

Charming me with mesmerizing visions,
Beguiled me with happy delusions.

Disappering in the blink of an eye,
Without a chance to say goodbye.

Captured my heart and vanished without a trace,
But left behind sweet pain in its place.
